**KEY CONCEPTS**
- Constant Pool: Generally refers to a structured collection of literals and constants used by a VM, accessed via indices, and often optimized for efficiency. In the context of the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), the constant pool is a specific section within each class file that stores all the constants and literals needed by that class. The constant pool is an essential part of the .class file format.

- Single Pool: A simplified constant pool where all types of constants are stored together in a single list, used in certain VMs like clox for simplicity and ease of implementation.

Summary of Differences
Focus:

chunk.c deals with the overall structure of bytecode, including managing and writing bytecode instructions and constants.
value.c is concerned with the handling and representation of values stored in dynamic arrays used within the interpreter.
Data Structures:

chunk.c contains the Chunk structure that includes both bytecode and a ValueArray for constants.
value.c focuses on the ValueArray and operations related to Value types.
Functionality:

chunk.c manages the bytecode stream and interactions with constants.
value.c provides functions for managing collections of values (constants) and ensures that they are properly allocated and freed.
